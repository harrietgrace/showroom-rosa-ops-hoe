== Introduction

Red Hat® OpenShift® GitOps is an operator that provides a workflow that integrates git repositories, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools, and Kubernetes to realize faster, more secure, scalable software development, without compromising quality.

OpenShift GitOps enables customers to build and integrate declarative git driven CD workflows directly into their application development platform. 

There's no single tool that converts a development pipeline to "DevOps". By implementing a GitOps framework, updates and changes are pushed through declarative code, automating infrastructure and deployment requirements, and CI/CD.

OpenShift GitOps takes advantage of https://argoproj.github.io/cd[Argo CD] and integrates it into Red Hat OpenShift to deliver a consistent, fully supported, declarative Kubernetes platform to configure and use with GitOps principles.

OpenShift and OpenShift GitOps:

* Apply consistency across cluster and deployment lifecycles
* Consolidate administration and management of applications across on-premises and cloud environments
* Check the state of clusters making application constraints known early
* Rollback code changes across clusters
* Roll out new changes submitted via Git

== Deploying your Application with OpenShift GitOps

. From the OpenShift Console Administrator view click through *HOME* \-> *Operators* \-> *Operator Hub*, search for "openshift gitops" and click *Install*.
+
For the update channel select *gitops-1.10*. Leave all other defaults and click *Install*.
+

. Wait until the operator shows as successfully installed (*Installed operator - ready for use*).

. In your terminal create a new project:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-project bgd
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Now using project "bgd" on server "https://api.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname
----

. The OpenShift Gitops operator includes the capability to deploy individual instances of ArgoCD for developers.
+
Deploy your personal ArgoCD into your development project:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1beta1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
  namespace: bgd
spec:
  sso:
    dex:
      openShiftOAuth: true
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 256Mi
        requests:
          cpu: 250m
          memory: 128Mi
    provider: dex
  rbac:
    defaultPolicy: "role:readonly"
    policy: "g, system:authenticated, role:admin"
    scopes: "[groups]"
  server:
    insecure: true
    route:
      enabled: true
      tls:
        insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
        termination: edge
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
argocd.argoproj.io/argocd created
----

. Wait for your ArgoCD server to be ready:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc rollout status deploy/argocd-server -n bgd
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment "argocd-server" successfully rolled out
----

. Now that you ArgoCD server is ready you can use it to deploy an application from a git repository. In this case the Kubernetes / OpenShift definition of the application is in the git repository https://github.com/rh-mobb/gitops-bgd-app. We won't have time to go into all the options but creating the `Application` tells ArgoCD to deploy the application from the Git repository into the namespace `bgd`.
+
Create the Application:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: bgd-app
  namespace: bgd
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: bgd
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  project: default
  source:
    path: apps/bgd/base
    repoURL: https://github.com/rh-mobb/gitops-bgd-app
    targetRevision: main
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: false
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=false
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
application.argoproj.io/bgd-app created
----

. Retrieve the URL for your Argo CD dashboard and navigate to it in your web browser:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo "https://$(oc -n bgd get route argocd-server -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
https://argocd-server-bgd.apps.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com
----

. ArgoCD is configured for single sign on with OpenShift. Therefore your admin credentials also work in ArgoCD. Click on the *Log in via OpenShift* button and use the admin credentials to log in (you may need to click on *Allow selected permissions* after the login step):
+
[subs="attributes"]
====
* *Admin user ID:* rosa-admin
* *Admin user Password:* {rosa_user_password}
====

. Once you have logged into ArgoCD yoiu should see the ArgoCD application dashboard.
+

. Click on the Application `bgd-app` to show its topology.
+
image::argo_sync.png[]

. Verify that OpenShift sees the Deployment as rolled out:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc rollout status deploy/bgd
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment "bgd" successfully rolled out
----

. Get the route and browse to it in your browser:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo "http://$(oc -n bgd get route bgd -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
bgd-bgd.apps.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com
----

. You should see a green box in the website like so:
+
image::bgd_green.png[]

. Patch the OpenShift resource to force it to be out of sync with the github repository:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n bgd patch deploy/bgd --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op": "replace", "path":
  "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/0/value", "value":"blue"}]'
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment.apps/bgd patched
----

. Refresh Your browser and you should see a blue box in the website like so:
+
image::app_blue.png[]

. Meanwhile check ArgoCD it should show the application as out of sync. Click the *Sync* button and then click on *Synchronize* to have it revert the change you made in OpenShift:
+
image::sync_bgd.png[]

. Check again, you should see a green box in the website like so:
+
image::bgd_green.png[]

*Congratulations!*

You have successfully deployed Red Hat OpenShift Gitops and used it to deploy and heal an application to your ROSA cluster.
