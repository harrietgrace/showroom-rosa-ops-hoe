This file needs to be included in all content files.
It is recommended at the top with the following syntax:

:lab_name: Name of the lab
include::_attributes.adoc[]

You may include in it any variables that you want to be available in all content files.

IMPORTANT, insure that the final line is:

include::include_vars.adoc[]

This file is typically *overwritten* at deploy time to allow automatic injection of variables.
